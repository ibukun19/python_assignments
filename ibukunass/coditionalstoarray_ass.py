# Python conditionals are statements that allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. 
# You can use the if, elif, and else keywords to create conditional statements in Python.
# # A simple conditional statement 
# x = 10
# if x > 0
# print("x is positive")
#elif x < 0:
# print("x is negative")
# else:
# print("x is zero")
