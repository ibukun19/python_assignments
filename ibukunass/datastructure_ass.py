# first assignment on data types
# LIST
# A list in Python is a collection of items that can be of different types, such as numbers, strings, or other lists.  
# Lists are mutable, which means they can be changed or modified in place. Lists are created by placing all the items inside square brackets [].
# Fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"]|
# For example add grape to the fruits list 
# fruits.append("grape")
# print(fruits) # ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "grape"]
# TUPLE
# A tuple in Python is a collection of items that can be of different types, such as numbers, strings, or other tuples. 
# Tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be changed or modified in place. Tuples are created by placing all the items inside parentheses ().
# my_tuple = (1, "Hello World", 3.5)
# print(my_tuple)
# SET
# A set in Python is a collection of objects that are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicates.
# my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# my_set.add("orange")
# print(my_set)
# DICTIONARY
# A dictionary in Python is a collection that allows us to store data in key-value pairs.
# A dictionary is written with curly brackets, and each key-value pair is separated by a comma.
# my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 36, "country": "Nigeria"}
# print(my_dict["name"])
